# PrintInterceptor Project Summary

## 1. Initial Review
- Reviewed existing project structure and files
- Identified main components of the PrintInterceptor application

## 2. Main Application Structure
- Created new Main.java as entry point
- Set up core components
- Implemented shutdown hook for cleanup

## 3. Print Monitoring
- Refined PrintMonitor class
  - Now detects new print jobs across all print queues
- Implemented PowerShell-based solution for Windows print system interaction

## 4. Print Job Handling
- Updated PrintJobHandler class
  - Manages flow of print jobs
  - Implemented concurrent job handling with ExecutorService
  - Added authentication and job management logic

## 5. User Interface
- Enhanced UserInterface class
  - More robust GUI
  - Added log area for displaying ongoing operations
  - Implemented methods for messages, errors, and authentication prompts

## 6. Printer Management
- Improved PrinterManager class
  - Enhanced functionality for resuming and cancelling print jobs
  - Improved error handling and logging in printer operations

## 7. Configuration Management
- Updated ConfigurationManager
  - Supports loading/saving configurations from file
  - Added default configuration values
  - Implemented type-specific getter methods

## 8. Logging
- Enhanced Logger class
  - Now writes to both console and log file
  - Implemented log levels for flexible logging

## 9. Installation
- Created Windows batch script (install.bat) for easy deployment
  - Checks for Java
  - Creates necessary directories
  - Sets up shortcuts

## 10. Documentation
- Updated README.md
  - Detailed installation and usage instructions
  - Sections on features, requirements, configuration, and troubleshooting

## Outcome
The result is a more robust and user-friendly PrintInterceptor application that effectively monitors print jobs, requires authentication, and manages print operations in a Windows environment. The code is now more modular and maintainable, with improved functionality, error handling, logging, and user experience.

## Next Steps
Potential areas for further development:
1. Write unit tests for each component
2. Implement additional features (e.g., print job queueing, advanced authentication)
3. Create a graphical configuration interface
4. Package the application as a Windows service for automatic startup
