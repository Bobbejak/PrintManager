# Print Job Interceptor Project Status Summary

## Achievements

1. Development environment setup:
   - Visual Studio installed and configured for C++ development
   - Project structure created for C++ component

2. Version control:
   - Git repository maintained with regular commits

3. Project structure:
   - Created separate folders for Java and C++ code
   - Established date-based working directories

4. Initial code setup:
   - Created PrintInterceptor.java with native method declaration
   - Set up PrintInterceptorNative.cpp for JNI implementation
   - Successfully generated JNI header file

5. C++ Project Configuration:
   - Configured Visual Studio project for JNI development
   - Set up include paths for JDK
   - Successfully built C++ project

6. Windows API Hooking:
   - Outlined implementation using Microsoft Detours library
   - Created basic structure for intercepting StartDocPrinterW function

## Next Steps

1. Detours Integration:
   - Install Microsoft Detours library
   - Configure project to use Detours for API hooking

2. Expand API Hooking:
   - Implement hooks for additional printing-related Windows APIs
   - Develop comprehensive print job interception logic

3. JNI Integration:
   - Finalize JNI method implementations in C++
   - Test communication between Java and C++ components

4. Print Job Management:
   - Implement logic to view, modify, or block intercepted print jobs
   - Develop criteria for print job handling

5. User Interface:
   - Create simple GUI or console interface for managing interception rules

6. Testing:
   - Develop unit tests for both Java and C++ components
   - Perform integration testing of the complete system

7. Documentation:
   - Update project documentation with detailed setup instructions
   - Document API hooking implementation and usage

8. Performance Optimization:
   - Profile the application to identify any performance bottlenecks
   - Optimize JNI calls and API hook overhead

9. Compatibility Testing:
   - Test the application across different Windows versions
   - Ensure compatibility with various printer drivers

10. Deployment Preparation:
    - Create an installer for easy setup on target machines
    - Prepare user documentation and readme files
